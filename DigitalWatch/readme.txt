The following components are needed before running the Digital-Watch project:

	
	The first thing you will need is the GTK# library. The GTK# library is part 
	of the Xamarin/Monodevelop IDE, but can also be obtained as a standalone library for the .NET Framework
		
		- The Xamarin IDE can be found at the following web address: http://xamarin.com/download

		- The Standalone GTK# library for use in combination with .NET resides on the following web address: 
		  http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-win (choose the GTK# for .NET option)



	The second thing you will need is the DS-Digital Font. The program will run fine without the font but will use a default font
	for the segment display.

		- The DS-Digital font can be obtained from the following web address: http://www.dafont.com/ds-digital.font
